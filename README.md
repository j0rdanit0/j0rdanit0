# Jordan Simpson - Software Developer :computer: :smile:

Hi there! I am a full stack software engineer that is passionate about creating innovative software solutions. I'm constantly looking for ways to apply software automation to improve quality of life, both for users and developers.

#### Things you can do:

:video_game: Check out [EchoBase](https://echobase.app), my popular guild tool for the mobile game *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*
<br/>
:speech_balloon: Play around with [EchoStation](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=416767534528987137&scope=bot&permissions=805829696), EchoBase's companion Discord bot
<br/>

:heart: Help support [El Puente](https://elpuentesearcy.org), a non-profit in central Arkansas whose mission is to provide assistance to the local Hispanic community (I maintain their websites!)
<br/>

When I'm not developing software, I get to work my favorite jobs: husband and father. :family:
