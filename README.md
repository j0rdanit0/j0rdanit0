### EchoBase

:video_game: Check out [EchoBase](https://echobase.app), my popular guild tool made specifically for the mobile gaming community of *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*!

* Used by **6,200+** guilds

Then play around with [EchoStation](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=416767534528987137&scope=bot&permissions=805829696), EchoBase's companion Discord bot, for a wealth of configuration options and additional supporting features.

* Running in **4,300+** Discord servers
* **4,000+** guilds have registered
* **146,000+** members have registered

**Pro tip:** Build your own SWGOH tool [using my Java API wrapper](https://github.com/j0rdanit0/api-swgoh-help) for the [api.swgoh.help](https://api.swgoh.help) API!
